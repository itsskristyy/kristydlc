            Hi! I'm Kristy De La Cruz and I'm a Software Engineer at Wells
            Fargo.

          <p>
            I am originally from Brooklyn, NY, and have since relocated to
            Charlotte, NC. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
            CUNY Brooklyn College.

            My passion for technology began in high school when I joined Girls
            Who Code, a nonprofit organization dedicated to closing the gender
            gap in tech by equipping girls with coding skills and career
            opportunities. Through this program, I learned the fundamentals of
            coding and web development, which inspired me to pursue Computer
            Science as my major. Since then, I have been committed to building
            applications that create meaningful impact and empower others.

            Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in the Blue Ridge Mountains,
            whether hiking or simply taking in the scenic views. I also love
            going on walks and watching moviesâ€”some of my favorites include The
            Twilight Saga and To All the Boys I've Loved Before.
